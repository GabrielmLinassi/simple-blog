                My name is John and living the simple life saved my life
              </h1>
              <p class="about-me__text">
                <b>I used to be a pack rat</b>. I had so many things that I
                thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even
                appreciate any of it because there was too much.
              </p>
              <p class="about-me__text">
                Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I
                didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
              </p>
              <h2 class="about-me__subtitle">How I turned things around</h2>
              <p class="about-me__text">
                <b
                  >I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of
                  everything</b
                >. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my
                place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
              </p>
              <p class="about-me__text">
                It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a
                bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
              </p>
              <h2 class="about-me__subtitle">Now I live the simple life</h2>
              <p class="about-me__text">
                Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better.
                I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more
                free time to enjoy.
              </p>
              <p class="about-me__text">
                With how much it turned my life around,
                <b
                  >I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did
                  it</b
                >, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well,
                which is why I started this site!
